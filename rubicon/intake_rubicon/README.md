# intake_rubicon

[Intake](https://github.com/intake/intake) is an open source library with the goal of
*"taking the pain out of data access and distribution"*. This module contains drivers
for Intake that allow it to read `rubicon` objects from remote storage.

See the [Intake docs](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) for a general
introduction to Intake and the **Collaborating and Sharing** section of the Rubicon docs'
**Quick Look** to see how to use Intake to share `rubicon` data.
