# Welcome to the `rubicon_ml` examples!

Here you'll find some interactive examples so you can try out `rubicon_ml` for yourself
without any setup required. If you'd like to learn more about `rubicon_ml` before getting
started, check out the [documentation on GitHub](https://capitalone.github.io/rubicon-ml/).

In the window below, you'll see two tabs. The first, titled **Exploring an Existing
`rubicon_ml` Project**, shows how you can use the dashboard to inspect and analyze some
existing model runs. The second tab, **Logging Your Own `rubicon_ml` Project**, shows
just how easy it is to get your existing model code integrated with `rubicon_ml`.

The examples found in the [**Examples**](https://capitalone.github.io/rubicon-ml/examples.html)
and [**Integrations**](https://capitalone.github.io/rubicon-ml/integrations.html) sections of
our documentation can be run in this session too! Using the file browser on the left, you
can navigate to the `notebooks` directory and launch the example notebooks within.
